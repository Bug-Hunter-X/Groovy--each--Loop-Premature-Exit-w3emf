This example demonstrates a common pitfall in Groovy when using the `each` method for iterating over lists.  The `return` statement inside the closure only exits the closure, not the loop. If you need to stop the iteration entirely when a certain condition is met, use `eachWithIndex` and a `break` statement, or consider using a different looping construct like a traditional `for` loop.
